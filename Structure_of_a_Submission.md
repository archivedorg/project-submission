# Structure of a Submission

To smooth out our collaboration process we request all proposals to be supplied through 
our standard response template. The formal submission document should be structured as follows:

 * Motivation and overview
 * Technical approach
 * Team background and qualifications
 * Evaluation plan
 * Security considerations
 * Schedule
 * Budget and justification
 * Email address(es) for direct contact

We would appreciate getting to know the key details as clearly as possible. You are free to modify 
this [sample template]() to suit your response, but we are aiming for structured correspondence with 
the community.


### Examples
