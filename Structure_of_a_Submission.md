# Structure of a Submission

To smooth out our collaboration process we request all proposals to be supplied through 
our standard response template. The formal submission document should be structured as follows:

 * Motivation and overview
 * Technical approach
 * Team background and qualifications
 * Evaluation plan
 * Security considerations
 * Schedule
 * Budget and justification
 * Email address(es) for direct contact

We would appreciate getting to know the key details as clearly as possible. You are free to modify 
this [sample template]() to suit your response, but we are aiming for structured correspondence with 
the community.


### Examples

If you would like to see some example responses then check out the following document in this repo: 
[submission-examples.md]()

### Submitting Process

Once you've familiazrized yourself with the submission template & example, submit your project by following
this easy steps:

* Fork this repository
* Create a `new-branch` labelled the title of your project e.g *data-mining-project*
* Update your changes on the new branched repo
* Push to branch and open a new PR

If your project is accepted, the branch will be merged and new repository for your project will be created 
at [Factory24](https://github.com/factory24).
