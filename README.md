At Factory24 we're always sourcing and onboarding projects with great ideas for building the 
next generation products and solutions to support the startup ecosystem. This public repository 
hosts the complete guideline of how to submit project ideas including templates and step-by-step 
instructions. 

## Scope

We are interested in onboarding projects that support both the Mission and Values of [Afrolynk](https://afrolynk.com/afrolyn2019/#section-brief). The scope of our focus areas is broad, and can include: `Big data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, 
Internet of Things(IOT) / Smart Machines, Blockchain, Augmented Reality /Virtual Reality,  Connectivity 
(Next Gen - 5G), Cloud & Quantum computing, API platforms (integration), Robotics & Automation, Instant 
Payments and appropriate technologies (USSD)`.

![Key Focus](img/key-focus.png "Key Focus")

With the ultimate goal of being the platform and the source of disruptive innovations in Africa, Factory24 
will help coordinate the efforts of teams working together to develop and build solutions that overcome 
current social-economic challenges. 

Our view is that Factory24 will play a pivotal role in transforming Africa's human capital in technology and 
leapfroging the continent into the 5th industrial revolution thus the coordination of efforts will include 
helping to connect teams, cross-promote the products and protocols, as well as provide strategic grants.

The intended scale is 1 to 6 person-months of effort, plus direct expenses such as servers and cloud services. 
If your project falls within our scope & scale refer to our **Structure of Submission** to begin submission process.

## Structure of a Submission

To smooth out our collaboration process we request all proposals to be supplied through 
our standard response template. The formal submission document should be structured as follows:

 * Motivation and overview
 * Technical approach
 * Team background and qualifications
 * Evaluation plan
 * Security considerations

We would appreciate getting to know the key details as clearly as possible. You are free to modify 
this [example template](https://github.com/factory24/project-submission/blob/master/submissions/example-template.md) 
to suit your response, but we are aiming for structured correspondence with the community.
