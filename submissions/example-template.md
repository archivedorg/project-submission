# Project Submission: `Example Submission`

**Name of Project:** Web Apps Generator

**Proposer:** `@factory24`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this project and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** `Yes`

## Project Description

This project aims to democratize application development for all level startups by eliminating the need to spend hours writing
and testing code. We will empower people to create sophisticated `Cross Platform Apps` like native mobile apps and desktop browser apps using `Drag & Drop` functions from their browser. 

By enabling all level start-ups to make enterprise apps visually without code or code generations - they'll concentrate on building highly advanced custome business applications with business workflow collaboration within a few days instead of months or years.

This project is designed to be dynamic and open source, which means any existing features can be customized to the exact way start ups need them to be, bringing critical `Digital Transformation` to start ups web-apps ranging from business apps, media & entertainment apps, events apps, education apps and even custom apps. 

## Deliverables

* Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be.
* **Evaluation Plan** - What would your project look like if successful, and how would we be able to tell? Include quantifiable     metrics if possible.
* **Security Considerations** - What are the implications of this project to the privacy and data integrity? Does it create, or     mitigate, potential attacks? Is user education needed to use it securely? This is especially relevant for technical projects.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the RFP scope.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Technical approach

How will it work? Convince us that your project has a good chance of meeting the goals of the motivation. What are the risks, unknowns and external dependencies, and how will you cope with them?

## Schedule

What is your timeline for the project? Please list several concrete milestones along this timeline.

## Budget and justification

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. 

How much money do you need, and how will you spend it (e.g., compensation for your effort, specific equipment, specific external services)? Specify a total in USD, and its breakup into 1-6 budget items with their rationale. Multiple alternatives, with different scope and cost, can be provided.

We expect a typical project to require approximately 3 pages to adequately discuss the above.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
