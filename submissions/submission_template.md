# Project Description

Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Since this is a response to an RFP, make sure to address the request directly. If the RFP asked for new ideas, please describe those novel ideas. If the RFP provided a clear scope of work, please make sure to acknowledge that you will be addressing that scope of work with this project.

This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. You can use the milestones suggested in the RFP or create your own. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the RFP scope.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Ensure that it does not exceed the total funding limit on the RFP.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.

# Additional Information

Please include any additional information that you think would be useful in helping us to evaluate your grant application.

### Motivation and overview

Why are you doing this? What impact will the project have if it is completely successful?

### Technical approach

How will it work? Convince us that your project has a good chance of meeting the goals of the motivation. What are the risks, unknowns and external dependencies, and how will you cope with them?

### Team background and qualifications

Summarize pertinent background of the team member(s). Optionally, attach CVs.

### Evaluation plan

What would your project look like if successful, and how would we be able to tell? Include quantifiable metrics if possible.

### Security considerations

What are the implications of this project to the privacy, integrity, availability and decentralization of Zcash (or other cryptocurrencies, if applicable)? Does it create, or mitigate, potential attacks? Is user education needed to use it securely? This is especially relevant for technical projects.

### Schedule

What is your timeline for the project? Please list several concrete milestones along this timeline.

### Budget and justification

How much money do you need, and how will you spend it (e.g., compensation for your effort, specific equipment, specific external services)? Specify a total in USD, and its breakup into 1-6 budget items with their rationale. Multiple alternatives, with different scope and cost, can be provided.

We expect a typical project to require approximately 3 pages to adequately discuss the above.

### Email address(es) for direct contact

GitHub issues are great for public discussion but the review committee occasionally prefers email addresses for direct communication.
