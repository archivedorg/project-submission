# Project Submission: `Project Title`

**Name of Project:**

**Proposer:** `replace with your GitHub username`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this project and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Please respond with either "Yes" or "No"

## Project Description

Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to address all the novel ideas directly. Provide a clear
scope of work of this project. Also briefly hightlight your motivations and project overview - Why are you doing this? What impact will the project have if it is completely successful?

This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

* Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be.
* **Evaluation Plan** - What would your project look like if successful, and how would we be able to tell? Include quantifiable     metrics if possible.
* **Security Considerations** - What are the implications of this project to the privacy and data integrity? Does it create, or     mitigate, potential attacks? Is user education needed to use it securely? This is especially relevant for technical projects.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the RFP scope.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Technical approach

How will it work? Convince us that your project has a good chance of meeting the goals of the motivation. What are the risks, unknowns and external dependencies, and how will you cope with them?

## Schedule

What is your timeline for the project? Please list several concrete milestones along this timeline.

## Budget and justification

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Ensure that it does not exceed the total funding limit on the RFP.

How much money do you need, and how will you spend it (e.g., compensation for your effort, specific equipment, specific external services)? Specify a total in USD, and its breakup into 1-6 budget items with their rationale. Multiple alternatives, with different scope and cost, can be provided.

We expect a typical project to require approximately 3 pages to adequately discuss the above.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.

## Team

    - Team Member 1
